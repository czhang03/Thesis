\section{Technical Background}

\subsection{Constructing Models}

Upper-triangular matrix model plays an important role in this paper.
Given a KA \(𝒦\), the square upper-triangular matrices over \(𝒦\) of size \(n\), 
denoted as \(M_{n}(𝒦)\), forms a Kleene Algebra, 
with matrix addition, matrix multiplication, 
and a star operation inductively defined as follows~\cite{Kozen_1994}:
\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
    A & B \\
    0 & D
  \end{bmatrix}^* ≜
  \begin{bmatrix}
    A^* & A^* B D^* \\  
    0 & D^*
  \end{bmatrix},
\]
where \(A, D\) are square block matrices, and \(B\) is a block matrix.

\begin{corollary}\label{the: diagonal projection is homomorphism}
  Projections of the diagonal element of upper-triangular matrices 
  are homomorphisms:
  \[π_{n, n}: M_{m}(𝒦) → 𝒦 \text{ where } n ≤ m.\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  By induction on the input term.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{the: diagonal image of free model is closed under sub KA}
  Given an interpretation into a matrix model \(I: \KA(X) → M_m(𝒦)\)
  and a Kleene subalgebra \(𝒦' ⊆ 𝒦\), 
  any diagonal projection \(π_{n, n}\) satisfy the following equivalences:
  \[∀ a ∈ X, π_{n, n}(I(a)) ⊆ 𝒦' ⟺ ∀ e ∈ \KA(X), π_{n, n}(I(e)) ⊆ 𝒦'.\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Direct consequence of \Cref*{the: diagonal projection is homomorphism}.
\end{proof}

Another important class of models are models bounded by a single element:
\begin{theorem}
  Given a KA \(𝒦\), and an element \(p ∈ 𝒦\), 
  if \(p ≥ 1\) and \(p ⋅ p ≤ p\), then all the element in \(𝒦\) that is smaller than \(p\)
  forms a Kleene Algebra.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We need to show that \(\{q ∣ q ≤ p\}\) is closed under all operation of KA.
  We will show the star case as an example.
  Given an element \(q ≤ p\), we need to show \(q^* ≤ p\).
  By induction rule \[q p ≤ p p ≤ p ⟹ q^* p ≤ p ⟹ q^* ≤ q^* p ≤ p.\qedhere\]
\end{proof}
We denote the Kleene algebra formed by all the elements in \(𝒦\) 
that is less than \(p\) as \(𝒦ₚ\).
