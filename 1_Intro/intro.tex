\section{Technical Background}

\subsection{Kleene Algebra and Homomorphisms}

A \emph{Kleene Algebra} (KA) is an idempotent semiring with an iteration operator \((-)^*\).
For a KA \(𝒦\) and elements \(p, q, r ∈ 𝒦\) the complete list of axiom is listed below:
\begin{align*}
  p + 0 = 0 + p & = p & \text{ identity} \\
  p + q &= q + p & \text{commutativity}\\
  (p + q) + r & = p + (q + r) & \text{associativity} \\
  p + p & = p & \text{idempotency} \\
  1 p = p 1 & = p & \text{identity} \\
  (p  q)  r & = p  (q  r) & \text{associativity}\\
  (p + q) r & = pr + qr & \text{right distributivity} \\
  r (p + q) & = rp + rq & \text{left distributivity} \\
  0 p = p 0 & = 0 & \text{annihilation} \\
  1 + p^* p = 1 + p p^* & = p^* 
  & \text{unfolding} \\
  q + pr ≤ r & ⟹ p^* q ≤ r & 
  \text{induction} \\
  q + rp ≤ r & ⟹ qp^* ≤ r & 
  \text{induction};
\end{align*} 
the ordering \(≤\) in KA inherits the conventional ordering in idempotent semiring
\[ p ≤ q ⟺ p + q = q.\]
Like every other algebraic structures, mapping between KA is an important subject of study.
As we will show later, a lot of the known concepts in KA 
can be defined using properties of maps between KA.
A \emph{KA homomorphism} between two KA \(𝒦\) and \(𝒦'\) is a map \(h: 𝒦 → 𝒦'\)
that preserves all the KA operations, namely, for all \(p, q ∈ 𝒦\) the following equations hold:
\begin{align*}
  h(p + q) &= h(p) + h(q) \\  
  h(p ⋅ q) &= h(p) ⋅ h(q) \\  
  h(p^*) &= h(p)^*.
\end{align*}


\subsection{Free KA And Interpretations}

In order to reason about logical properties like completeness about KA,
it is important to define expressions and interpretations in Kleene algebra.
A \emph{KA alphabet} \(K\) is a finite set; we call the elements \(p ∈ K\) \emph{primitives}.
Given an alphabet \(K\), 
we can construct all the Kleene Algebra terms over \(K\) with the following grammar:
\[e = p ∈ K ∣ 1 ∣ 0 ∣ e₁ + e₂ ∣ e₁ ⋅ e₂ ∣ e^*.\]
And these terms forms the free KA:
\begin{definition}[Free KA]
  The free KA \(\KA(K)\) over an alphabet \(K\) is a KA 
  s.t. for all KA \(𝒦\) and a set map \(Î: K → 𝒦\),
  there exists a unique KA homomorphism \(I: \KA(K) → 𝒦\), where the following diagram commutes:
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \KA(K) \ar[dashed]{r}{I} & 𝒦 \\  
    K \ar[swap]{ur}{Î} \ar[hookrightarrow]{u}{i}
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  where \(i: K → \KA(K)\) is the inclusion map.
  Since there exists a bijection between set maps \(Î: K → 𝒦\) 
  and homomorphisms \(I: K → 𝒦\),
  we will use \(I\) to denote both \(Î\) and \(I\) for simplicity.
  We will also sometimes omit \(K\) and just write \(\KA\)
  if \(K\) is irrelevant or can be inferred from context.
  We sometimes say \(I\) is \emph{lifted} from the action on the primitives \(Î\).
\end{definition}

The free KA over \(K\) can be constructed as all the KA terms over \(K\)
modulo provable equalities in KA. 
The operations in free KA is purely syntactic, 
for example, the addition of two terms \(e₁, e₂ ∈ \KA(K)\) will 
simply yield the term \(e₁ + e₂\).
Furthermore, the homomorphism \(I: \KA(K) → 𝒦\) is inductively generated 
from \(Î: K → 𝒦\) as follows:
\begin{align*}
  I & : \KA(K) → 𝒦 \\
  I & (p) ≜ Î(p) & p ∈ K \\
  I & (e₁ + e₂) ≜ I(e₁) + I(e₂) \\  
  I & (e₁ ⋅ e₂) ≜ I(e₁) ⋅ I(e₂) \\  
  I & (t^*) ≜ I(t)^*
\end{align*}
The uniqueness of \(I\) can be derived by unfolding the definition of homomorphisms.
Homomorphisms from free KA is called \emph{KA interpretations}.
By definition of the free KA, 
a KA interpretation is uniquely determined by the action on the primitives, i.e.
for two interpretations \(I, I': \KA(K) → 𝒦\):
\[∀ p ∈ K, I(p) = I'(p) ⟺ ∀ e ∈ \KA(K), I(e) = I'(e).\]

\subsection{Complete Models}

One important property for interpretation is completeness.
We say an interpretation \(I\) is \emph{complete} when the following equivalence holds:
\[∀e₁, e₂ ∈ \KA(K), e₁ = e₂ ⟺ I(e₁) = I(e₂).\]
If we consider \(I\) as a desirable semantics for \(\KA(K)\),
then this means that all the semantical equalities can be derived using just the theory,
a very desirable quality of a proof system.

One of such complete interpretation, as we have mentioned before, is the language interpretation.
Kozen has showed that the powerset of any monoid generates a Kleene Algebra~\cite{Kozen_2002},
and the language KA over alphabet \(K\) is generated by the free monoid over \(K\), 
where we denote the identity as \(ϵ\).
More explicitly, the language KA over \(K\) can be defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item The carrier set is all the languages (sets of words) over the alphabet \(K\).
  \item The additive identity \(0\) is the empty set. 
  \item The multiplicative identity \(1\) is the singleton set with the empty string \(\{ϵ\}\).
  \item The addition operation is set union.
  \item The multiplication operation is element-wise concatenation:
    \[l₁ ⋅ l₂ ≜ \{w₁ w₂ ∣ w₁ ∈ l₁, w₂ ∈ l₂\}.\]
  \item The star operation is the closure under finite concatenation:
    \[l^* ≜ ⋃_{i ∈ ℕ} l^{i} \text{ where } l^0 ≜ ϵ, l^{(j + 1)} ≜ l^{j} ⋅ l.\]
\end{itemize}
The language interpretation of KA is defined by lifting the following action on primitives \(p\):
\[L(p) ≜ \{p\}.\]
The completeness result of the language interpretation is a seminal result in Kleene algebra,
proven independently by Kozen and Korb~\cite{Kozen_1994,Krob_1991}, 
and the proof was later improved several times~\cite{Kozen_2001,Silva_2010,Kozen_Silva_2020}.



\subsection{Constructing Models}

Upper-triangular matrix model enjoys nice properties that will be crucial in later development.
Given a KA \(𝒦\), the square upper-triangular matrices over \(𝒦\) of size \(n\), 
denoted as \(M_{n}(𝒦)\), forms a Kleene Algebra, 
with matrix addition, matrix multiplication, 
and a star operation inductively defined as follows~\cite{Kozen_1994}:
\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
    A & B \\
    0 & D
  \end{bmatrix}^* ≜
  \begin{bmatrix}
    A^* & A^* B D^* \\  
    0 & D^*
  \end{bmatrix},
\]
where \(A, D\) are square block matrices, and \(B\) is a block matrix.

\begin{corollary}\label{the: diagonal projection is homomorphism}
  Projections of the diagonal element of upper-triangular matrices 
  are homomorphisms:
  \[π_{n, n}: M_{m}(𝒦) → 𝒦 \text{ where } n ≤ m.\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  By unfolding the definition
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{the: diagonal image of free model is closed under sub KA}
  Given an interpretation into a matrix model \(I: \KA(X) → M_m(𝒦)\)
  and a Kleene subalgebra \(𝒦' ⊆ 𝒦\), 
  any diagonal projection \(π_{n, n}\) satisfy the following equivalences:
  \[∀ a ∈ X, π_{n, n}(I(a)) ⊆ 𝒦' ⟺ ∀ e ∈ \KA(X), π_{n, n}(I(e)) ⊆ 𝒦'.\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Direct consequence of \Cref*{the: diagonal projection is homomorphism}.
\end{proof}

Another important class of models are models bounded by a single element:
\begin{theorem}
  Given a KA \(𝒦\), and an element \(p ∈ 𝒦\), 
  if \(p ≥ 1\) and \(p ⋅ p ≤ p\), then all the element in \(𝒦\) that is smaller than \(p\)
  forms a Kleene Algebra.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We need to show that \(\{q ∣ q ≤ p\}\) is closed under all operation of KA.
  We will show the star case as an example.
  Given an element \(q ≤ p\), we need to show \(q^* ≤ p\).
  By induction rule \[q p ≤ p p ≤ p ⟹ q^* p ≤ p ⟹ q^* ≤ q^* p ≤ p.\qedhere\]
\end{proof}
We denote the Kleene algebra formed by all the elements in \(𝒦\) 
that is less than \(p\) as \(𝒦ₚ\).



\subsection{KAT}

A classical extension of KA is Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT)~\cite{Kozen_Smith_1997}, 
which is a two-sorted algebra \((ℬ, 𝒦)\), s.t. 
\(ℬ\) is a boolean algebra; \(𝒦\) is a Kleene algebra; 
and \(ℬ\) is a subalgebra of \(𝒦\) where the disjunction and conjunction operator in \(ℬ\)
respectively coincide with the addition and multiplication in \(𝒦\).

A \emph{KAT alphabet} consists of two disjoint finite set \(K, B\);  
the elements in \(K\) are called \emph{primitive actions} 
and the elements in \(B\) are called \emph{primitive tests}.
Given a KAT alphabet \(K, B\), we can define KAT terms as follows:
\[t = p ∈ K ∣ b ∈ B ∣ \overline{t_b} ∣ 1 ∣ 0 ∣ t₁ + t₂ ∣ t₁ ⋅ t₂ ∣ t^*,\]
where \(t_b\) do not contain any primitive actions.
Notice boolean terms like \(t₁ ∨ t₂\) are not presented here, 
this is because the disjunction operator coincide with addition, 
hence by definition \(t₁ ∨ t₂\) is the same as \(t₁ + t₂\).
