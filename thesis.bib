  abstract  = {The equational theory generated by all algebras of binary relations with operations of union, composition, converse and reﬂexive transitive closure was studied by Bernátsky, Bloom, Ésik, and Stefanescu in 1995. We reformulate some of their proofs in syntactic and elementary terms, and we provide a new algorithm to decide the corresponding theory. This algorithm is both simpler and more eﬃcient; it relies on an alternative automata construction, that allows us to prove that the considered equational theory lies in the complexity class PSpace.},

  abstractnote = {Incorrectness Logic (IL) has recently been advanced as a logical theory for compositionally proving the presence of bugs—dual to Hoare Logic, which is used to compositionally prove their absence. Though IL was motivated in large part by the aim of providing a logical foundation for bug-catching program analyses, it has remained an open question: is IL useful only retrospectively (to explain existing analyses), or can it actually be useful in developing new analyses which can catch real bugs in big programs?
                  In this work, we develop Pulse-X, a new, automatic program analysis for catching memory errors, based on ISL, a recent synthesis of IL and separation logic. Using Pulse-X, we have found 15 new real bugs in OpenSSL, which we have reported to OpenSSL maintainers and have since been fixed. In order not to be overwhelmed with potential but false error reports, we develop a compositional bug-reporting criterion based on a distinction between latent and manifest errors, which references the under-approximate ISL abstractions computed by Pulse-X, and we investigate the fix rate resulting from application of this criterion. Finally, to probe the potential practicality of our bug-finding method, we conduct a comparison to Infer, a widely used analyzer which has proven useful in industrial engineering practice.},

This includes tools to find vulnerabilities, discover bugs, and perform taint tracking. Recovering high-level control constructs is essential for decompilation in order to produce structured code that is suitable for human analysts and sourcebased program analysis techniques. State-of-the-art decompilers rely on structural analysis, a pattern-matching approach over the control flow graph, to recover control constructs from binary code. Whenever no match is found, they generate goto statements and thus produce unstructured decompiled output. Those statements are problematic because they make decompiled code harder to understand and less suitable for program analysis.},

  abstract = {The B{\textasciidieresis}ohm{\textendash}Jacopini theorem (B{\textasciidieresis}ohm and Jacopini, 1966) is a classical result of program schematology. It states that any deterministic flowchart program is equivalent to a while program. The theorem is usually formulated at the first-order interpreted or first-order uninterpreted (schematic) level, because the construction requires the introduction of auxiliary variables. Ashcroft and Manna (1972) and Kosaraju (1973) showed that this is unavoidable. As observed by a number of authors, a slightly more powerful structured programming construct, namely loop programs with multi-level breaks, is sufficient to represent all deterministic flowcharts without introducing auxiliary variables. Kosaraju (1973) established a strict hierarchy determined by the maximum depth of nesting allowed. In this paper we give a purely propositional account of these results. We reformulate the problems at the propositional level in terms of automata on guarded strings, the automata-theoretic counterpart to Kleene algebra with tests. Whereas the classical approaches do not distinguish between first-order and propositional levels of abstraction, we find that the purely propositional formulation allows a more streamlined mathematical treatment, using algebraic and topological concepts such as bisimulation and coinduction. Using these tools, we can give more mathematically rigorous formulations and simpler and more revealing proofs.},

In this paper, we study the (co)algebraic properties of GKAT. Our initial focus is on the fragment that can distinguish between unsuccessful programs performing different actions, by omitting the so-called early termination axiom. We develop an operational (coalgebraic) and denotational (algebraic) semantics and show that they coincide. We then characterize the behaviors of GKAT expressions in this semantics, leading to a coequation that captures the covariety of automata corresponding to behaviors of GKAT expressions. Finally, we prove that the axioms of the reduced fragment are sound and complete w.r.t. the semantics, and then build on this result to recover a semantics that is sound and complete w.r.t. the full set of axioms.},
