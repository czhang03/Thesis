% ABSTRACT

Kleene Algebra (KA) is an equational system celebrated for its decidability 
and completeness with respect to regular language equalities.
Because of the desirable properties of Kleene Algebra, 
numerous extensions were developed to reason about
network system~\cite{Anderson_Foster_Guha_Jeannin_Kozen_Schlesinger_Walker_2014,Foster_Kozen_Milano_Silva_Thompson_2015, Smolka_Kumar_Kahn_Foster_Hsu_Kozen_Silva_2019},
concurrent programs~\cite{hoare_ConcurrentKleeneAlgebra_2009,Kappé_Brunet_Silva_Wagemaker_Zanasi_2020,Kappé_Brunet_Silva_Zanasi_2018}, 
probabilistic systems~\cite{mciver_UsingProbabilisticKleene_2006, McIver_Rabehaja_Struth_2011}, 
relational verification~\cite{Antonopoulos_Koskinen_Le_Nagasamudram_Naumann_Ngo_2022},
and program schematology~\cite{Angus_Kozen_2001}.
Most of the above systems has been shown to be complete and decidable.
In this thesis, we focus on three variants of Kleene Algebra with real-world applications.

The first system, Kleene Algebra with tests and top (TopKAT), 
was developed to perform domain and reachablity reasoning.
We showed the conventional extension of Kleene Algebra with tests, 
despite able to encode Hoare logic, is inadequate for domain reasoning.
This leads to our development of TopKAT, which is complete for domain reasoning.
TopKAT was able to sound and completely encode propositional incorrectness logic~\cite{OHearn_2020},
offering better complexity bound than alternative implementations~\cite{Möller_O’Hearn_Hoare_2021, Sedlár_2023}.
The main proof heavily relies on a technique called \emph{reduction},
we showed that the reduction from TopKAT to KAT satisfy nice properties that enable
us to generate complete interpretations for TopKAT for free,
and also gives us a complete and decidable coalgebraic theory with minimal efforts.
