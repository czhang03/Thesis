% ABSTRACT

Kleene Algebra (KA) is an equational system celebrated for its decidability 
and completeness with respect to regular language equalities.
Because of the desirable properties of Kleene Algebra, 
numerous extensions were developed to reason about
network system~\cite{Anderson_Foster_Guha_Jeannin_Kozen_Schlesinger_Walker_2014,Foster_Kozen_Milano_Silva_Thompson_2015, Smolka_Kumar_Kahn_Foster_Hsu_Kozen_Silva_2019},
concurrent programs~\cite{hoare_ConcurrentKleeneAlgebra_2009,Kappé_Brunet_Silva_Wagemaker_Zanasi_2020,Kappé_Brunet_Silva_Zanasi_2018}, 
probabilistic systems~\cite{mciver_UsingProbabilisticKleene_2006, McIver_Rabehaja_Struth_2011}, 
relational verification~\cite{Antonopoulos_Koskinen_Le_Nagasamudram_Naumann_Ngo_2022},
and program schematology~\cite{Angus_Kozen_2001}.
In this thesis, we focus on two variants of Kleene Algebra with real-world applications.

The first system, Kleene Algebra with tests and top (TopKAT), 
was developed to perform domain and reachablity reasoning.
We showed the conventional extension of Kleene Algebra with tests, 
despite able to encode Hoare logic, is inadequate for domain reasoning.
This leads to our development of TopKAT, which is complete for domain reasoning.
TopKAT was able to sound and completely encode propositional incorrectness logic~\cite{OHearn_2020},
offering better complexity bound than alternative implementations~\cite{Möller_O’Hearn_Hoare_2021, Sedlár_2023}.
The main proof heavily relies on a technique called \emph{reduction},
we showed that the reduction from TopKAT to KAT satisfy nice properties that enable
us to generate complete interpretations for TopKAT for free,
and also gives us a complete and decidable coalgebraic theory with minimal efforts.

The second system, control-flow Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (CF-GKAT) verifies control-flow transformations.
Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests~\cite{Smolka_Foster_Hsu_Kappé_Kozen_Silva_2020} provides a robust system that is not only sound and complete with respect to trace equivalence, but also enjoys a efficient decision procedure. 
However, GKAT remains insufficient as a system to verify several well-known control-flow algorithms~\cite{erosa-hendren-1994,yakdan_NoMoreGotos_2015,kozen_BohmJacopiniTheorem_2008a}, because it lacks important control-flow structures like indicator variable and non-local control-flow structures like \(\comBrk\), \(\comRet\), and \(\command{goto}\).
To obtain CF-GKAT, we extended the syntax and semantics of GKAT to incorporate these essential features. We have developed a efficient decision procedure for CF-GKAT program utilizing \emph{CF-GKAT automata}, an automat model that closely emulates CF-GKAT programs, and can be efficiently lowered into GKAT automata.
